# Cratetime - Pet Management App

Welcome to Cratetime, a comprehensive pet management app designed to help you organize and manage your pets' needs efficiently. Whether you have one pet or several, Cratetime makes it easy to keep track of everything from feeding schedules to vet appointments.

## Why Cratetime?

The inspiration for Cratetime came from my personal experiences raising a puppy and kittens. The main issue I faced was miscommunication among family members about who did whatâ€”such as taking the dog for a potty break or feeding the dog. This same issue occurred while raising kittens, who need around-the-clock care. We had to text each other in a group chat whenever we bottle-fed them or changed the litterbox to ensure everyone was on the same page. Cratetime was created to alleviate these issues by providing a centralized platform for managing and tracking pet care activities.
